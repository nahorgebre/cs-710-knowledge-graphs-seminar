## Abstract
Wikipedia was originally conceived in 2001 as a text-based resource. But the amount of structured data such as numbers, dates, coordinates, and many types of relationships, from family trees to species taxonomy, has steadily increased in Wikipedia. According to the Wikimedia Foundation’ vision of giving everyone access to knowledge, Wikipedia must contain data that can be searched, analysed, and reused. But most of the data in Wikipedia cannot be accessed through query services or by downloading data dumps. The obvious divide between vision and reality lies in the fact that Wikipedia’s data is contained in over 30 million Wikipedia articles in about 300 languages. In addition, the information in the various language versions of Wikipedia articles may differ. Wikidata, a sister project of Wikipedia, was launched in October 2012 to clean up this structured data and store it in a central location. Wikidata is a kind of multilingual Wikipedia for data.
